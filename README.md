Hi there! Welcome to the shared repository for the Atmospheric Sciences Coding Initiative and Implementation (ASCII) club at the University of Georgia. 

# PLEASE READ

Since you are learning to code, you may want to create cool stuff for others to use. That is great, and encouraged! However, you also must be responsible and use common sense. 

In the case that you upload to our repo, you accept that you are relinquishing your software to all persons on this repo to do with it as they please. You accept responsibility for your creation and any effects thereof, wanted or unwanted. This includes, but is not limited to: academic dishonesty, pirating copyrighted materials, or knowingly creating and distributing malicious software. If you are found to abuse your spot on this repo, you may be removed and reported to the proper organization(s). 

Computing is amazing, but it is also a big responsibility for everyone in terms of security and integrity.

How to create conda environments on the server:


1. In jupyterhub, open a terminal
2. Run the following commands without double quotes IN ORDER:








“conda create -n newenv ipykernel”
“conda activate newenv”
“python -m ipykernel install --user --name newenv --display-name 'Python (newenv)'”


Feel free to change “newenv” to whatever you want the name of your environment to be.
